# A Personal Website with React

This project was created in Sep 2021 because I was bored at home (because none of my roommates were at home) and this has been something in the back of my mind forever. 
<br>
<br>
By making this, I can now use the domain name that was gifted to me back when I turned 12, <br>
... toy with the idea that I can be a front-end god even though I am a business kid, <br>
... scream at the computer because the colour of the button is not right, <br>
... <b> AND </b> provide an URL in all those job applications I've been applying to.

## LinkedIn Inspiration or rather "LinkedOut"

The styling of this is based heavily on LinkedIn. <br>
<b>BUT</b> this is not LinkedIn, this is <i> LinkedOut </i>. <br>
A shoutout to my friend who was sick of seeing everyone on LinkedIn flexing their accomplishments gave me this idea, allowing me to use this play on word.
